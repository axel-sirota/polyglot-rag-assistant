# Current Issues - Polyglot RAG Assistant

## Date: 2025-07-06 01:40

### 1. Flight API Price Parsing Error (CRITICAL)
**Status**: 🔴 Broken  
**Error**: `could not convert string to float: '$892'`  
**Location**: `agent.py` in search_flights function  
**Root Cause**: API returns prices as strings with dollar signs (e.g., '$892') but code tries to convert directly to float  
**Occurrences**: Every flight search attempt fails

**Evidence from logs**:
```
2025-07-06 01:34:19,381 - Searching flights: Buenos Aires -> New York on 2024-07-10
2025-07-06 01:34:20,713 - ERROR - Search error: could not convert string to float: '$892'
```

**Fix Required**:
- Strip dollar sign before float conversion in agent.py
- Handle different currency symbols if present
- Add error handling for malformed price data

### 2. Flight API Authentication Issues (CRITICAL)
**Status**: 🔴 Not configured properly  
**Error**: API returns generic error messages instead of flight data  
**Location**: Flight search API endpoints  
**Root Cause**: API keys not properly configured or expired

**Evidence from logs**:
- All flight searches return: `{'status': 'error', 'message': "I'm having trouble searching for flights right now. Please try again."}`

### 3. Language Support Not Working (HIGH)
**Status**: 🟡 Partially working  
**Issue**: System is configured for multilingual support but only responds in English  
**Expected**: Should detect and respond in Spanish, French, Chinese, etc.  
**Actual**: All conversations happen in English only

**System prompt includes**:
```
CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULES:
1. DETECT the language the user is speaking in (Spanish, English, French, Chinese, etc.)
2. ALWAYS respond in the EXACT SAME language the user used
```

**Testing Required**:
- Test with Spanish: "Quiero buscar vuelos de Buenos Aires a Nueva York"
- Test with French: "Je cherche des vols de Paris à Londres"
- Test with Chinese: "我想查找从北京到上海的航班"

### 4. Date Handling Issues (MEDIUM)
**Status**: 🟡 Incorrect year  
**Issue**: Agent uses 2023 dates instead of 2024/2025  
**Example**: User says "October 7" → Agent searches for "2023-10-07"

**Evidence from logs**:
```
2025-07-06 01:36:13,038 - Searching flights: Buenos Aires -> New York on 2023-10-07
```

### 5. ECS API Health Checks Only (LOW)
**Status**: 🟢 Running but not serving flight data  
**Issue**: ECS logs show only health check endpoints being hit  
**Location**: /ecs/polyglot-rag-prod/api CloudWatch logs

**Evidence**:
- 100% of requests are GET /health
- No flight search endpoints being called
- No errors in ECS logs

## Summary of Issues

1. **Flight Search Completely Broken**: Price parsing error prevents any successful flight searches
2. **Multilingual Support Not Working**: Despite configuration, only English is supported
3. **API Authentication**: Flight APIs not properly configured or missing credentials
4. **Date Logic**: Using past years instead of current/future dates
5. **ECS Deployment**: API is running but not being used for flight searches

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Fixes:
1. Fix price parsing in agent.py - strip currency symbols
2. Verify and update flight API credentials
3. Fix date logic to use current year or future dates

### Testing Required:
1. Test multilingual support with non-English inputs
2. Verify flight API endpoints are accessible
3. Test end-to-end flow from UI → API → Agent

### Deployment Steps:
1. Fix code issues locally
2. Test thoroughly with different languages and queries
3. Build and push new Docker image
4. Deploy to ECS with updated environment variables
