# OpenAI Realtime API - Multilingual Voice Assistant Guide

## How It Works

The OpenAI Realtime API natively supports **57+ languages** with automatic language detection and translation capabilities. Here's how our implementation uses these features:

### 1. Automatic Language Detection
When a user speaks in ANY language (Spanish, French, Chinese, etc.), the Realtime API:
- Automatically detects the language using Whisper
- Transcribes the speech in the original language
- Understands the intent regardless of language

### 2. Internal Translation for Function Calls
The GPT-4o model internally:
- Translates city names to English for the flight search API
- Examples:
  - "Nueva York" → "New York"
  - "París" → "Paris"
  - "Londres" → "London"

### 3. Response in Original Language
The assistant:
- Responds in the SAME language the user spoke
- Maintains conversation context in that language
- Provides flight results with proper formatting for that language

## Configuration

```javascript
// In realtime_client.py
"input_audio_transcription": {
    "model": "whisper-1",  // Multilingual transcription
    // No language specified = auto-detection
},
"instructions": """
    1. Users may speak in ANY language
    2. You should UNDERSTAND their request regardless of language
    3. Always RESPOND in the SAME language the user spoke
    4. Internally, translate city names to English for the flight search
"""
```

## Example Interactions

### Spanish
**User**: "Quiero encontrar vuelos entre Buenos Aires y Nueva York"
**Assistant**: "¿Para qué fecha necesitas el vuelo de Buenos Aires a Nueva York?"
**Internal**: search_flights(origin="Buenos Aires", destination="New York")

### French
**User**: "Je veux aller de Paris à Londres"
**Assistant**: "Quand souhaitez-vous voyager de Paris à Londres?"
**Internal**: search_flights(origin="Paris", destination="London")

### Chinese
**User**: "我想从北京飞到上海"
**Assistant**: "您想什么时候从北京飞往上海？"
**Internal**: search_flights(origin="Beijing", destination="Shanghai")

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Pre-Translation Needed**: The Realtime API handles all language detection and understanding
2. **Natural Conversations**: Users can speak naturally in their language
3. **Accurate Function Calls**: City names are properly translated for API calls
4. **Consistent Experience**: Responses maintain the user's language throughout

## How Interruptions Work with Multilingual

When a user interrupts in any language:
1. The `conversation.interrupted` event fires
2. Audio is immediately stopped
3. The new speech is transcribed in whatever language is detected
4. The conversation continues in that language

## Supported Languages (57+)

Including but not limited to:
- Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese
- Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, Korean
- Arabic, Hindi, Russian, Dutch
- Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai
- And many more...

## Key Events for Multilingual Support

```javascript
// User's speech transcribed (any language)
"conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed"
"conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.delta"

// Assistant's response (in user's language)
"response.audio_transcript.delta"
"response.audio.delta"
```

## Testing Multilingual Features

1. Click "Start Listening"
2. Speak in ANY language
3. The system will:
   - Detect your language automatically
   - Understand your flight request
   - Respond in your language
   - Search for flights with proper city translations

No configuration needed - it just works!
