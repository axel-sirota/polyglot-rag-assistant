# LiveKit Agent Voice Output Issue - Comprehensive Research Request

## Problem Summary
We have a LiveKit agent that successfully connects to rooms, receives audio input, shows proper state transitions (listening ‚Üí speaking), but produces NO AUDIO OUTPUT despite appearing to process everything correctly. The agent uses OpenAI Realtime API for voice processing.

## Environment Details

### Package Versions
```
livekit==1.0.11
livekit-agents==1.1.5
livekit-api==1.0.3
livekit-plugins-cartesia==1.1.5
livekit-plugins-deepgram==1.1.5
livekit-plugins-openai==1.1.5
livekit-plugins-silero==1.1.5
livekit-protocol==1.0.4
openai==1.93.0
Python 3.11.2
```

### LiveKit Cloud Setup
- URL: `wss://polyglot-rag-assistant-3l6xagej.livekit.cloud`
- Region: Brazil
- Protocol: 16

## Agent Implementation

### Current Code Structure
```python
from livekit.agents import AgentSession, JobContext, WorkerOptions, cli, llm, vad
from livekit.agents.voice import AgentCallContext, AgentState
from livekit.plugins import deepgram, silero, openai, cartesia
import livekit.rtc as rtc

async def prewarm(proc: JobProcess):
    # Prewarm VAD model
    proc.userdata["vad"] = silero.VAD.load(activation_threshold=0.3)
    logger.info("Models prewarmed successfully")

async def entrypoint(ctx: JobContext):
    vad = ctx.proc.userdata["vad"]
    
    # Connect to room with audio only
    await ctx.connect(auto_subscribe=AutoSubscribe.AUDIO_ONLY)
    
    # Create agent with OpenAI
    agent = openai.LLM.with_bq(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        instructions="You are a flight search assistant...",
        tools=[search_flights]
    )
    
    # Initialize session with OpenAI Realtime
    try:
        session = AgentSession(
            llm=openai.realtime.RealtimeModel(
                voice="alloy",
                model="gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17",
                temperature=0.8,
                tool_choice="auto"
            ),
            vad=vad,
            turn_detection="vad"  # Warning: ignored for RealtimeModel
        )
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to STT-LLM-TTS pipeline
        session = AgentSession(
            vad=vad,
            stt=deepgram.STT(model="nova-3"),
            llm=openai.LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
            tts=cartesia.TTS(),
            turn_detection="vad"
        )
    
    # Start session
    await session.start(agent=agent, room=ctx.room)

# Run with WorkerOptions
cli.run_app(
    WorkerOptions(
        entrypoint_fnc=entrypoint,
        prewarm_fnc=prewarm,
    )
)
```

## Observed Behavior

### What Works ‚úÖ
1. **WebRTC Connection**: Successfully established
   - ICE connected, DTLS connected
   - Audio tracks subscribed from user
   - Both inbound-rtp and outbound-rtp statistics show data flow

2. **Agent State Transitions**: Proper state changes observed
   ```
   ü§ñ Agent state changed: initializing -> listening
   üë§ User state changed: listening -> speaking (when user talks)
   üë§ User state changed: speaking -> listening (when user stops)
   ü§ñ Agent state changed: listening -> speaking (agent "responds")
   ü§ñ Agent state changed: speaking -> listening (agent "finishes")
   ```

3. **Room Connection**: Agent successfully joins room
   - Receives job requests
   - Subscribes to user audio track
   - Shows 2 participants in room (user + agent)

### What Doesn't Work ‚ùå
1. **No Audio Output**: Despite agent state showing "speaking", no audio is heard
2. **No Errors**: No exceptions or errors in logs
3. **No Track Publishing Logs**: Don't see explicit audio track publishing from agent

## Browser Console Output
```javascript
// Connection successful
Connected to room: flight-demo
Participant connected: agent-AJ_U7AQEMB2qstf
Track subscribed: audio agent-AJ_U7AQEMB2qstf

// WebRTC stats show:
- inbound-rtp: receiving audio from agent
- outbound-rtp: sending audio to agent
- Connection state: connected
- ICE state: connected
```

## Debug Information
- Agent runs on port 8081 for debug/tracing
- Worker status: `{"agent_name": "", "worker_type": "JT_ROOM", "active_jobs": 0}`
- Running in dev mode which accepts all rooms

## Key Findings

1. **OpenAI Realtime Limitation**: Cannot use `session.say()` method
   - Error: "trying to generate speech from text without a TTS model"
   - Realtime model should handle speech natively through conversation

2. **Room Metadata**: Agent requires specific metadata
   ```json
   {"require_agent": true, "agent_name": "polyglot-flight-agent"}
   ```

3. **Turn Detection Warning**: 
   ```
   turn_detection is set to 'vad', but the LLM is a RealtimeModel 
   and server-side turn detection enabled, ignoring the turn_detection setting
   ```

## Previous Working Implementation
Reference: https://github.com/techwithtim/LiveKit-AI-Voice-Assistant
- Uses VoiceAssistant pattern (older)
- We use AgentSession pattern (newer)
- Both should work according to docs

## Questions for Research

1. **Audio Publishing in AgentSession**: 
   - How does AgentSession with OpenAI Realtime publish audio tracks?
   - Is there a missing step for audio track creation/publishing?
   - Are there specific callbacks or events we need to handle?

2. **OpenAI Realtime Integration**:
   - Has the integration changed in recent LiveKit versions?
   - Are there known issues with `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17`?
   - Is there a specific configuration required for audio output?

3. **Version Compatibility**:
   - Are these package versions compatible?
   - Have there been breaking changes in AgentSession behavior?
   - Is there a version mismatch between livekit and livekit-agents?

4. **Audio Track Publishing**:
   - Should we see explicit track publishing logs?
   - Is audio automatically published by AgentSession?
   - Do we need to manually create/publish audio tracks?

5. **Debugging Approach**:
   - How can we verify if OpenAI Realtime is actually generating audio?
   - Are there additional debug flags or logging we can enable?
   - Can we intercept the audio stream before it's published?

## Additional Context
- This is a 3-day demo project for a conference
- Need working voice interaction urgently
- Fallback STT-LLM-TTS pipeline also doesn't produce audio
- Agent worked briefly in earlier sessions but stopped producing audio

## Request
Please help identify why the LiveKit agent shows all signs of working correctly (state transitions, WebRTC stats, no errors) but produces no audible output. Focus on recent changes to LiveKit's AgentSession implementation and OpenAI Realtime integration.
