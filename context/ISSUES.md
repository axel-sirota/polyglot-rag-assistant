# Current Issues - Polyglot RAG Assistant

## Last Updated: July 4, 2025

## 1. Voice Interruption - Critical Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è üö®

### Current Problem (WORSE)
Using `response.cancel` causes the assistant to stop speaking prematurely, even when there's no interruption. The assistant cuts itself off mid-sentence.

### Previous Issues
1. When user interrupts, OpenAI API continued sending all audio chunks
2. `conversation.item.truncate` returned "item_id not found" errors
3. Audio continued playing after interruption

### Failed Attempts
1. ‚ùå Using `conversation.item.truncate` with "current" - API error
2. ‚ùå Using `response.cancel` - Assistant stops mid-sentence
3. ‚ùå Client-side audio management - Audio chunks still arrive from API
4. ‚ùå Response ID tracking - Helps but doesn't stop API sending chunks

### Root Cause
The OpenAI Realtime API's VAD and response management doesn't align well with interruption expectations. The API either:
- Continues sending all audio (original problem)
- OR stops too aggressively (current problem with response.cancel)

### Potential Solutions
1. Implement WebRTC connection instead of WebSocket for better control
2. Use client-side VAD with manual audio control
3. Add push-to-talk mode as fallback option

## 2. API Key Issues üîë

### Issue
Both flight search APIs return authentication errors despite user providing keys:
- AviationStack: 403 Forbidden errors
- SerpAPI: 401 Invalid API key errors

### Current State
System falls back to mock flight data with realistic routes and prices.

### Potential Issues
1. API keys might be expired or have wrong permissions
2. AviationStack endpoint might be incorrect (tried /flights, /flightsFuture, /routes)
3. SerpAPI key format might be wrong

### Alternative Solutions
- Use Browserless.io for web scraping (key provided: `***REMOVED***`)
- Try Amadeus API (has free tier)
- Use Skyscanner API

## 3. Message Ordering in Chat üí¨

### Issue
Sometimes assistant messages appear before user messages in the chat display, creating confusion about the conversation flow.

### Root Cause
Asynchronous message handling - assistant starts responding before user transcript is finalized.

### Proposed Solution
Implement message queue with proper ordering:
1. Buffer user messages until transcription is complete
2. Show typing indicator during processing
3. Ensure user message appears before assistant response

## 4. High Latency Without Feedback ‚è±Ô∏è

### Issue
During flight searches, there's no user feedback while the API is being called, creating perception of unresponsiveness.

### Proposed Solutions
1. Add "Searching for flights..." message immediately
2. Show progress indicator
3. Stream partial results as they arrive
4. Add timeout with graceful fallback

## 5. Audio Worklet Deprecation Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Issue
Browser console shows: "The ScriptProcessorNode is deprecated. Use AudioWorkletNode instead."

### Impact
Currently works fine but may break in future browser versions.

### Solution
Migrate audio processing to use AudioWorkletNode API for better performance and future compatibility.

## 6. Language Detection Locale Issue üåç

### Issue
System sometimes defaults to Spanish, possibly due to browser locale or cache.

### Current State
Fixed by removing `"language": null` from configuration and using Whisper auto-detection.

### Status
‚úÖ Resolved - but monitor for regression

## 7. Incomplete Error Handling üö®

### Issue
Some API errors cause silent failures without user feedback.

### Examples
- Flight search API failures show in logs but not to user
- WebSocket disconnections don't always show clear error messages

### Solution
Add comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages for all failure modes.

## Known Working Features ‚úÖ

1. **Multi-language support** - Auto-detects and responds in 12 languages
2. **Voice streaming** - Continuous bidirectional audio works well
3. **Real-time transcription** - Shows user speech as they talk
4. **Audio playback** - Assistant voice responses work correctly
5. **UI layout** - Responsive design with chat on right, controls on left
6. **Mock flight data** - Realistic fallback data for common routes

## Testing Scenarios That Fail ‚ùå

1. **Rapid interruptions** - Multiple interruptions in quick succession
2. **Mid-word interruption** - Interrupting in the middle of a word
3. **Long responses** - Assistant continues for many chunks after interruption
4. **Real flight data** - API authentication issues

## Recommended Testing Flow üß™

1. Start with simple query: "Find flights from New York to Paris"
2. Let assistant complete response
3. Try interrupting with "Actually, I want business class"
4. Test language: "Buscar vuelos de Madrid a Barcelona"
5. Test interruption during Spanish response
6. Check if audio stops properly after interruption
