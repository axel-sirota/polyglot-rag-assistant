# Language Support Findings - Polyglot RAG Assistant

## Overview
This document summarizes the findings and fixes implemented to resolve language support issues in the LiveKit Polyglot RAG Assistant.

## Problem Statement
The agent was joining Spanish language rooms but only speaking English, despite the user selecting Spanish as their preferred language.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Deepgram STT Language Override
**Issue**: Deepgram's `detect_language` parameter was causing the configured language to be ignored.
- When `detect_language` is not explicitly set to `False`, Deepgram overrides the language parameter
- This caused all requests to default to Nova-3 English model regardless of configuration

**Fix**: Added `detect_language=False` to Deepgram STT configuration:
```python
stt=deepgram.STT(
    model=deepgram_config["model"],
    language=deepgram_config["language"],
    sample_rate=48000,
    detect_language=False  # CRITICAL: Prevent language nullification
)
```

### 2. Room Metadata Not Being Set
**Issue**: LiveKit rooms were created without metadata, preventing language detection.
- The API server was not properly creating rooms with metadata before participant joins
- Room metadata is required for the agent to detect language preference
- Room metadata persists and doesn't update with new tokens

**Fix**: Updated API server to properly create rooms with metadata:
```python
room_info = await lkapi.room.create_room(
    api.CreateRoomRequest(
        name=room_name,
        metadata=metadata_str
    )
)
```

### 3. Inadequate Logging
**Issue**: Lack of proper logging made debugging difficult.
- API server was using print statements instead of proper logging
- No visibility into room creation process
- No logging of actual STT configuration after creation

**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging throughout:
- API server now uses proper logging module
- Added detailed room metadata logging
- Added STT configuration logging after creation

## Language Configuration Architecture

### Centralized Language Support
Created comprehensive `language_config.py` with:
- Support for 35+ languages across Deepgram Nova-2 and Nova-3 models
- Proper model selection based on language capabilities
- Language-specific greetings and welcome-back messages
- Fallback mechanisms for language variants

### Supported Languages
The system now supports:
- **European**: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Polish, Czech, Romanian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Catalan
- **Asian**: Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malay
- **Middle Eastern**: Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish
- **Slavic**: Russian, Ukrainian
- **Others**: Greek, and more

### Model Selection Logic
- **Nova-3**: Used for English-only mode (best English accuracy) and multilingual mode
- **Nova-2**: Used for single non-English languages (better accuracy than Nova-3 multi)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Language Detection Flow
1. User selects language in web interface
2. Web app creates room with name pattern `flight-demo-{language}`
3. Room metadata includes language preference
4. Agent reads language from room metadata
5. STT/TTS configured with appropriate language settings

### 2. Greeting System
- Initial greetings for new participants
- Welcome-back messages for reconnecting users
- All messages available in 35+ languages
- Centralized in language configuration

### 3. API Integration
- LiveKit API properly integrated using `api.LiveKitAPI()`
- Room creation with metadata working correctly
- Token generation includes proper metadata

## Testing Results
- Spanish language now works correctly
- Agent responds in the selected language
- Greetings are displayed in the appropriate language
- Language persists across reconnections

## Best Practices Discovered
1. Always set `detect_language=False` when using specific languages with Deepgram
2. Create rooms with metadata before participants join
3. Use proper logging throughout for debugging
4. Centralize language configuration for maintainability
5. Test with actual API calls, not mocks

## Future Improvements
1. Add more languages as Deepgram expands support
2. Implement language auto-detection as a fallback option
3. Add language preference persistence per user
4. Support mid-conversation language switching
